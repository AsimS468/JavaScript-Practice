Challenge 1: Filter Even Numbers and Double Them
-------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Write a JavaScript code that takes an array of numbers as input. The function should:
1. Use a loop (either for or while) to iterate through the array.
2. Use a conditional statement to check if a number is even.
3. If the number is even, double its value and store it in a new array.
4. log the new array.

Example Input:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Expected Output:
[4, 8, 12, 16]

-------------------------------------------------

Challenge 2: Categorize Numbers into Even and Odd Arrays
-------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Write a JavaScript code that takes an array of numbers as input. The function should:
1. Use a loop (either for or while) to iterate through the array.
2. Use conditionals to check if each number is even or odd.
3. Store even numbers in one array and odd numbers in another.
4. log an object containing both arrays.

Example Input:
[10, 15, 22, 33, 40, 55]

Expected Output:
{
  even: [10, 22, 40],
  odd: [15, 33, 55]
}

-------------------------------------------------

Challenge 3: Find the Largest Number in an Array
-------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Write a JavaScript code that takes an array of numbers as input. The function should:
1. Use a loop (either for or while) to iterate through the array.
2. Use a conditional statement to keep track of the largest number found.
3. log the largest number.

Example Input:
[5, 12, 8, 20, 3, 25, 7]

Expected Output:
25

-------------------------------------------------

Challenge 4: Reverse a String
-------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Write a JavaScript code that takes a string as input and logs the reversed version of the string.
You must use a loop to iterate through the characters and construct the reversed string.

Example Input:
"hello"

Expected Output:
"olleh"

-------------------------------------------------

Challenge 5: Count Vowels in a String
-------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Write a JavaScript code that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in it.
Log the count as an integer.

Example Input:
"javascript"

Expected Output:
3

-------------------------------------------------

Challenge 6: Capitalize the First Letter of Each Word
-------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Write a JavaScript code that takes a sentence as input and capitalizes the first letter of each word.
Log the modified string.

Example Input:
"hello world from javascript"

Expected Output:
"Hello World From JavaScript"

-------------------------------------------------

Challenge 7: Convert all challenges into functions
-------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Convert all the javascript challenges into functions
-------------------------------------------------

Challenge 8: Use challenge functions in html
-------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Output the challenge functions to a p tag in the relevant html. the html should also have an input 
tag so that you can input the strings or arrays you want processed. The code should also check the types
